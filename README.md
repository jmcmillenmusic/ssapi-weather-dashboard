# SSAPI-Weather-Dashboard

## Description

As I delve into the world of server-side application programming interfaces (APIs), I've discovered that there are a plethora of APIs for anything and everything. Developers have been using these to gather all types of data, and it's important that other developers know how to retrieve and (most importantly) interpret said data in a way that people can understand. One way that I've accomplished this is to construct a Weather Dashboard to showcase my ability to retrieve and interpret weather data for any given city from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Installation

You can access this page with the following URL:
[https://jmcmillenmusic.github.io/ssapi-weather-dashboard/](https://jmcmillenmusic.github.io/ssapi-weather-dashboard/)

## Usage

Click in the Search bar and the left side, enter the name of any city, and click on the Search button below it. Your city name will be saved as a new button below, and you'll see weather information generated to the right including the current conditions, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. You'll also see a 5-day forecast for said city. You can enter another city to repeat this process, and you can click on any of the generated buttons to see that city's forecast again.
